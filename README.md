## Introduction - Online Game Industry
For the past decade, the shift from physical to digital has been very disruptive to music, and movies, and more so the gaming industry. Video game industry is silently taking over the entertainment world. There was a time when brothers are fighting for one console to top each otherâ€™s score on Tetris in Gameboy. Today we have E-sports tournaments which take the form of multiplayer video game competitions between teams of professional gamers.

Gone are the days when gaming was an activity to pass the time. The game culture has grown out of its niche community, which brings different perspectives in profit-generating channels from merchandising to live events, streaming services, online advertising, and brand endorsement; literally taking the game to the center stage with a global audience1.

With two major catalysts 1) the network effect and 2) the fast network which made streaming game services feasible, video game industry has easily outpaced their contemporaries in the film and music industry, with below graph showing direct consumer spending as the highest within the gaming sector.
